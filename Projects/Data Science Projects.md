Data Science Projects

1. Titanic Data Set
As the name suggests (no points for guessing), this data set provides the data on all the passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic ocean. It is the most commonly used and referred to data set for beginners in data science. With 891 rows and 12 columns, this data set provides a combination of variables based on personal characteristics such as age, class of ticket and sex, and tests one’s classification skills.

Objective: Predict the survival of the passengers aboard RMS Titanic.

2. Text Mining Data Set
In simple words, text mining means analysing data within text. Large amounts of unstructured data is found within natural language.  Mining this unstructured data from sources such as  e-mails, text messages and other platforms like Facebook and Twitter, can help companies gain business insights about customers, and their patterns and topics of interest.

Data sets from the famous competition, What’s Cooking?, can help you get started in the area of text mining. The goal is to use recipe ingredients to categorize cuisines.

Text mining data sets test skills on classification and clustering. Occasionally, regression analysis may be required.

Objective: Classification and categorisation based on tags or labels.

3. Boston Housing Data Set
Published originally in 1978, in a paper titled 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air’, this data set contains the data collected by the U.S Census Service for housing in Boston, Massachusetts. It was collected for a study that aimed at ascertaining if the availability of clean air influenced the value of houses in Boston.  

With only 506 rows and 14 columns, this is a small data set that seeks the discovery of ideal explanatory variables. It is very popular in pattern recognition literature and serves as a regression analysis problem.

Objective: Predict the median value of occupied homes.

4. Census Income Data Set
Also known as the Adult Census Income data set, this data set from the 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys, was extracted by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker, from the U.S. Census Bureau database.  

It contains the extracted weighted census data, and has 41 employment and demographic related variables.

While the the original table contained 199,523 rows and 42 columns, the newer refined versions of the data set contain anywhere between 14-16 columns and above 30,000 rows. It is a commonly cited data set of KNN(know nearest neighbors) and is a classification problem.

Objective:  Predict whether income exceeds $50,000 per year.

5. Movie Lens Data Set
Similar to the above mentioned Titanic Data Set, it is one of the most popular and commonly quoted data sets in data science. This data set provides the exciting opportunity of building one’s own movie recommendation engine and is available in many sizes.

The smallest set meant for the purpose of education and development contains 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users. While the largest set meant for the same purpose contains 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users.

It also contains stable benchmark data set of 20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users.

Objective: Make movie suggestions for users.

6. Walmart Sales Forecasting Data Set
Retail industry is a front-runner in the large scale employment of data science. Areas such as product placement, inventory management and customization of offers, are sought to improve constantly through the application of data science. Walmart is one such retailer.

This data set provides information on the historical sales data of 45 stores of Walmart, each of which having various departments. The goal is to predict the department-wise sales of each store using the historical data spanning across 143 weeks.

Walmart is also known for conducting promotional markdown events before major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Super Bowl among others. The difference between the weightage given to the data of regular weeks and the weeks including holiday seasons, coupled with unavailability of complete historical data, adds another level of difficulty of factoring the effects of the markdowns on the sales during the holiday weeks. This is a regression analysis problem.

Objective: Predict the sales across various departments in each store.

7. Chicago Crime Data Set
With the increasing demand to analyse large amounts of data within small time frames, organisations prefer working with the data directly over samples. This presents a herculean task for a data scientist with limitation of time.

Extracted from Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, this data set contains information on reported incidents of crime in the city of Chicago from 2001 to present, with the absence of data from the most recent seven days. Not included in the data set, is data on murder, where data is recorded for each victim.

It contains 6.51 million rows and 22 columns, and is a multi-classification problem. In order to achieve mastery over working with abundant data, this data set can serve as the ideal stepping stone in the pursuit of tackling mountainous data.

Objective: Explore the data, and provide insights and forecasts about crimes in Chicago.

8. Hubway Data Visualization Challenge
A well known example of a trip history project is the Hubway Data Visualization Challenge. This data set comes from the Boston-based bicycle sharing service, Hubway. Originally launched in 2013, the competition sought a visualization of the company’s trip history from the date of its official launch on 28 July 2011 till the end of September 2012. Variables within the data include duration, membership type, gender, and destinations among others.

The data provides an engaging exercise in data wrangling and serves as a classification problem

Objective: Provide a visualization of the data (answer questions on user patterns).

9. Iris Data Set
This is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could be simpler than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. If you are totally new to data science, this is your start line. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.

Objective: Predict the class of the flower based on available attributes.

10. Loan Prediction Dataset
Among all industries, the insurance domain has one of the largest uses of analytics & data science methods. This dataset provides you a taste of working on data sets from insurance companies – what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome, etc. This is a classification problem. The data has 615 rows and 13 columns.

Objective: Predict if a loan will get approved or not.
